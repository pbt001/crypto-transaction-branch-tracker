Crypto Transaction Branch Tracker(CTBT) is a program that will allow you to easily keep track of your cryptocurrency investments by allowing you to create branches.

A branch is a series of investments/payments that are made, up until the point you have sold. By doing this, you can quickly see exactly how much money you have invested in a cryptocurrency in your current branch. This means that CTBT allows you to, at a glance, see if selling right now would generate a profit or not.
